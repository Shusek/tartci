# Optional per-host guest resolvers for disposable macOS guests.
#
# A guest takes its resolver from the host's vmnet DHCP (192.168.64.1), and the
# host answers it by forwarding to its own resolver. When that is Tailscale
# MagicDNS, every guest on every such host shares the tailnet's single global
# nameserver, so one stall there fails npm/cargo/curl lookups in gate VMs on
# several hosts in the same minute while the jobs themselves are fine.
#
# With `[guest_network] dns_servers` in the fleet profile (read through
# host_profile.py as guest_dns_servers), the runner points the guest's primary
# network service at those resolvers before it registers, proves one lookup
# through them, and otherwise puts the DHCP resolver back. Every failure is
# fail-open: the guest keeps the resolver it booted with and the job runs
# exactly as it would have without the knob. Absent (the default) this is a
# no-op.
#
# Callers provide: tartci_profile_value, event, note, ssh (with SSH_OPTS,
# SSH_KEY_PRIV, VM_USER).
