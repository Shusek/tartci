# shellcheck shell=bash
# Guest diagnostics for a runner that could not start one of its own tools.
#
# A merge-group job on m5 passed every step, then failed "Post Run
# actions/checkout" with "An error occurred trying to start process
# '.../externals/node24/bin/node' ... Exec format error". The same binary had
# run a tenth of a second earlier in that job, and the guest, which held the
# only evidence of why, was destroyed at teardown. When the runner's own logs
# show such a spawn failure, this captures the guest's memory state, the
# externals' identity and signatures, and a short unified-log window before
# the VM is discarded. Every call is bounded in time and the saved output in
# size, so a wedged guest costs at most the stated budget and never the job.
#
# Requires from the caller: SSH_OPTS, SSH_KEY_PRIV, VM_USER, STATE_DIR,
# TARTCI_ROOT and an `event` function.
