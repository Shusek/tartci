# Install (or refresh) the per-host disk-reclaimer LaunchAgent.
#
# Unlike install_self_update_agent.sh, `tartci setup` DOES run this. The
# distinction is what the agent does to the host: an update takes the host down,
# which is an operator decision, while the reclaimer is what keeps the host
# alive. A tartci host admits work by lease and the lease has a disk axis, so a
# full data volume denies every lease and the host stops serving entirely —
# m5 reached 14 GiB free with 488 build dirs and refused 276 leases before
# anyone noticed. Leaving that to a manual step is how three hosts ended up
# without it.
#
# Idempotent, and safe to call on every setup: it renders the template, and only
# writes + (re)bootstraps when the rendered plist differs from what is installed
# or the label is not loaded. An unchanged, loaded agent is left strictly alone,
# because bootout/bootstrap of a running janitor mid-pass leaves state no later
# pass can classify.
