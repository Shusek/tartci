       [--mode dry-run|reap] [--repo-root PATH] [--install]

Validates and prints the install plan by default. --install writes the mode-600
canonical config, renders the LaunchAgent, bootstraps it, and verifies launchd
received the expected paths and the first tick reports healthy. The default
mode is dry-run; reap discards ship-state for merged, closed or confirmed
nonexistent pull requests. The tick never merges: landing is the GitHub merge
queue's job. --repo-root only sets the directory the merge-queue hold check
runs from. Every mode requires an explicit GitHub App wrapper.
