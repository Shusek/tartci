# Install (or refresh) the artifact-cache mirror refresher LaunchAgent.
#
# `tartci setup` runs this. The agent is a no-op on a host whose artifact cache
# holds no git mirror (refresh never creates one), so installing it everywhere
# changes nothing until a host opts in with `tartci artifact-cache git-sync`,
# and from then on keeps that mirror current without anyone remembering to.
#
# Same shape and guards as install_reclaim_agent.sh: idempotent, writes and
# (re)bootstraps only when the rendered plist differs or the label is not
# loaded, boots out a registration held from any other plist, and never touches
# the real gui/<uid> domain from a temporary HOME.
