"""Every ssh client invocation must say what its stdin is.

An ssh client forwards its stdin to the remote command. Called from inside a
`while read ... done <<< "$list"` loop, it drains the rest of the list, and the
loop ends early with no error. That is #371: `gate_supply.py decide` read
peers over ssh from inside the supervisor's class loop, and every class after
the first with young demand went unobserved.

shellcheck catches the direct form (SC2095, warning severity, run by
`scripts/lint.sh`), but not this one: the ssh was inside a Python helper the
loop called, and shellcheck cannot see through a process or a function
boundary. So this check does not ask whether a call sits in a loop. It asks
every ssh invocation to state its stdin, wherever it is:

  shell   `ssh -n`, an input redirect on the same command (`</dev/null`,
          `<<EOF`, `<<<`, `< file`), or ssh as the right side of a pipe.
          `ssh -G` (print config, no connection) is exempt.
  Python  a list or tuple whose first element is "ssh" (or a name called
          `ssh`) must contain "-n". A literal is checked rather than the
          subprocess call, because the argv is often built far from the call.

A command that genuinely forwards its caller's stdin (a wrapper whose callers
pipe a script into it) carries the comment `ssh-stdin: <reason>`, on its line
or the line above, and is skipped.

Usage: ssh_stdin_check.py [ROOT]   prints one line per finding; exit 1 if any.
