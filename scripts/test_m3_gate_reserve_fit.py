"""m3's Pulp gate VMs must fit together inside its gate core reserve.

m3 is a dedicated-builder host: the lease store withholds the role's
`vm_pool_cores` from non-gate leases and lends everything else to agent builds.
When the gate lane's slots together asked for more than that reserve (2 x 12
against 14), the second gate VM could start only while agent builds held almost
nothing, so a gate slot sat lease-denied with jobs queued. Sizing every slot to
fit the reserve means agent builds can never starve a gate slot.

Scoped to m3 on purpose: other hosts size their reserve differently (m5studio
runs 2 x 8 against a 16-core reserve), so a fleet-wide rule against the role
default would be wrong.
