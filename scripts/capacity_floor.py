"""Refuse a pool mutation that would take the last capacity for a required
label offline.

`tartci pool drain` and `tartci pool off` stop this host from serving. When
this host holds the only runners carrying a required gate label, that mutation
takes the label to zero runners and every pull request waiting on that gate
stalls until someone notices. Nothing about the mutation looks wrong while it
happens: the host reports a clean drain, and the damage is visible only in the
repository's queue.

The guard answers one question first: does a machine other than this one serve
each required label this host declares? A label another host still serves is
free to drain. A label only this host serves refuses, naming the label and the
host, and proceeds only under an explicit `--allow-last-serving-host`.

A label is also served elsewhere when another fleet host mints its runners on
demand. Fleet runners are ephemeral JIT registrations that exist only while they
hold a job, so "no other host has a runner registered right now" is the normal
idle state of a healthy fleet, not a missing server; counting only registered
runners made every quiet moment read as "last serving host" and left a host
unable to drain except while a peer happened to be mid-job. So when the census
finds no other runner, the guard also asks every other host that DECLARES a lane
tier for the label in the published supply (fleet/advertised-labels.json)
whether it is provably live and serving now, by reading that host's own `pool
status --json` over SSH. A peer counts only when every field proves it: pool on
and participating, managed and fleet-ready, no fleet problems (a stale heartbeat
is one), every expected supervisor verified running, serving not blocked, and
installed supply matching the published supply. Off, draining, unreadable,
unreachable or older peers do not count, and the refusal names each peer it
considered and why.

Every indeterminate answer refuses. An unreachable runner scope, a host with no
resolvable identity, and a persistent runner whose registered name cannot be
derived are all cases where "another host is serving" and "nobody is" look
identical from here, so the guard treats them as the dangerous one.

Which labels are required: the gate-class labels a fleet lane declares in its
`[[lane.tier]]` rows, plus any `--required-label` passed by the caller. The
base capability labels a lane carries (`self-hosted`, `macOS`, …) are not
gate classes and are not protected here.

Who owns a runner: fleet registrations are named `<host-id>-<lane>-<slot>` and
their per-boot registrations extend that name, so a registration carrying this
host's identity prefix belongs to this host and one that does not belongs to
another machine. Persistent Actions services are named by their launchd label
(`actions.runner.<owner>-<repo>.<runner-name>`) and are matched by that name.
