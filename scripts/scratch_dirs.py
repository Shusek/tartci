"""Remove stale test and validation scratch from the boot volume's temp roots.

Why this exists: on 2026-10-01 m3's boot data volume went from 57 GiB free to
2 GiB in a day while everything m3 builds is supposed to live on Workshop.
The space was scratch that test runs and Shipyard's local validation leave
in the two temp roots on the boot volume when they are killed or cannot
remove what they made:

  * /private/tmp/shipyard-validation-*: Shipyard's per-run TMPDIR. A run that
    is killed never drops it, and its own cleanup cannot remove a pack a Pulp
    test installed read-only (`pulp-fetch-install-*/<sha>/ui.js`). One held
    28 GiB.
  * $TMPDIR/tmp*/older-clean-clone: a Pulp test's full `git clone
    --no-hardlinks` of a 20 GiB repository, left whole or half-copied when the
    test is killed mid-clone.
  * $TMPDIR/pulp-* and shipyard-test-* prefixes named in PATTERNS below.
  * .../X/com.google.Chrome.code_sign_clone/code_sign_clone.*: the copy of
    Google Chrome.app Chrome makes at launch and removes only on an orderly
    exit; every killed headless Chrome leaves one (168 on m3). Chrome's own
    $TMPDIR/com.google.Chrome.* scratch is left the same way (932 on m3).
  * $TMPDIR/pulp-<words>-<mkdtemp suffix>: any Pulp test or tool scratch.
    1,505 had built up on m3 in ten days, from 30-odd tests that were killed
    or never cleaned up. A suffix must hold a digit, capital or underscore,
    so a fixed-name directory a tool reuses on purpose never matches.
  * ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*: Xcode's build products, which an
    agent's xcodebuild leaves at 3 to 8 GiB a project (39 GiB on m3). They
    are rebuilt on the next build, and are removed only after
    DERIVED_DATA_IDLE_HOURS (14 days) with nothing inside modified.

/private/tmp and the per-user temp dir are outside every other reclaim root
(build dirs and checkouts), so nothing removed them.

An entry is removed only when every gate holds:

  * it is a direct child of its pattern's root, matches that pattern, is a
    real directory (not a symlink) and is owned by the user running the pass;
  * no process has a file open inside it (one `lsof` listing per pass) and no
    process command line or environment names it (`ps -E`; a live Shipyard
    validation exports it as TMPDIR). Either listing failing removes nothing;
  * nothing inside it, within a bounded walk, was modified inside the idle
    gate (`scratch_idle_hours`, default 12; `PRESSURE_IDLE_HOURS` while the
    boot volume is below its floor), re-read immediately before removal.

Removal makes the directories it owns writable first, because the leak this
exists for is a read-only tree nothing else could remove. Patterns are an
explicit list: anything not named here is never examined.
