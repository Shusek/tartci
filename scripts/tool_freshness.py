"""Installed-vs-released freshness for the host tools a fleet host runs.

tartci measures its own skew against main (`fleet_self_update.py`). The other
tools every gate and agent session on the host depends on, Shipyard and the
pulp CLI, had no equivalent, and an installed pulp CLI sat ~2,800 hours behind
its releases before anyone looked. This module gives each of them one line in
`tartci pool status`, a finding in `tartci doctor fleet`, and a WARN in the
launchd watchdog, and optionally applies the update itself:

  refresh   (the watchdog, at most every 30 minutes) reads the installed
            version by running the tool, and the published releases from
            the repository's public Atom feed (no REST quota). A tool whose
            installed version is older than the newest release is `behind`
            since that newer release was published; it is STALE once that is
            more than `stale_hours` ago. When a tool has an `apply_command`
            and `auto_apply`, a behind tool is updated once its newest
            release is `apply_after_minutes` old, at most once per target per
            `apply_retry_hours`, and the result is re-read and verified.
            A tool with `release_assets` (pulp) is first checked for readiness:
            every asset listed on the GitHub release and HEAD 200. A release
            that is not ready, or an apply that exits NOT_READY_EXIT (75: a
            download failed, nothing installed), is "not ready yet": re-checked
            on the next refresh, never recorded as an attempt, and reported as
            a problem only after `not_ready_alert_hours` (6). The per-target
            guard covers only failures after the downloads succeeded.
  events    every change of an installed version, whoever made it, appends
            one `tool_deployed` event (tool, from, to, verify) to
            events.jsonl; an automatic apply that did not land appends
            `tool_apply_failed`; a release still not ready after the alert
            window appends one `tool_release_incomplete`.
  summary   reads only the cached state; it never runs a tool or fetches.

A tool with a `generation_link` (Shipyard's ghapp auth generation) is also
measured through that generation's own `shipyard --version`; the older of
the two decides whether the tool is behind, so a generation left on an old
release reads STALE even when the CLI is current.

Settings (optional) live in ~/.config/tartci/tool-freshness.toml:

    stale_hours = 12
    host_class = "studio"         # default: the installed fleet profile's host.id
    [tools.shipyard]
    auto_apply = false            # stop automatic Shipyard updates here
    [tools.pulp]
    auto_apply = false            # measure the pulp CLI but never install it here
    local_archive_dir = "{home}/pulp-archives"   # optional <tag>/pulp-<platform>.tar.gz,
                                  # used only when its sha256 matches the release

`{home}`, `{tag}` and `{host_class}` are substituted in commands. A tool whose binary is
absent is `not_installed`, which is reported but is never a problem.
