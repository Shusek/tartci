# Refuse to register a LaunchAgent into the REAL gui/<uid> launchd domain from
# anything but the account's own home.
#
# Why: launchd's gui/<uid> domain is keyed by uid, not by $HOME. An installer
# run with a temporary HOME (every test fixture does this) writes its plist into
# that temp dir and then bootstraps it into the one real domain, where the label
# REPLACES the real agent: the installer boots the real job out first because
# the rendered plist "differs". On m3 a shell test ran `tartci setup` with
# HOME=$tmp/home, which reached install_reclaim_agent.sh --install; the disk
# reclaimer then ran $tmp/home/.local/bin/tartci from a deleted directory,
# exited 127 every hour for a day, and the Workshop volume filled until every
# gate VM lease was refused.
#
# A test double (TARTCI_LAUNCHCTL_BIN) cannot reach the real domain, so it is
# always allowed. The real launchctl is allowed only when HOME is the account's
# home and the plist lives in that home's LaunchAgents directory.
#
# Usage (sourced):  tartci_launchd_domain_guard TARGET_PLIST LAUNCHCTL
# Returns 0 when registering is safe; prints why and returns 1 otherwise.
