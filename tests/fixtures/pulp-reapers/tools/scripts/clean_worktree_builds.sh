# clean_worktree_builds.sh — reclaim `build/` directories from finished worktrees.
#
# Every agent session and every parallel slice gets its own worktree, and each
# worktree grows a 10-40 GB `build/`. Nothing reaps them: the documented cleanup
# ("git worktree remove … after landing") depends on remembering, and dozens of
# sessions end without a tidy closeout. The shared volume fills, and the next
# person to touch it gets a build that dies for space while reporting something
# else entirely. `clean_build_cov.sh` covers `build-cov` only, by design; this
# covers the far larger `build/`.
#
# It removes a worktree's `build/` — never the worktree, never source, never
# uncommitted work. The worst case is a rebuild.
#
# THE GATE — all of these must hold, or the directory is kept:
#
#   1. STRUCTURE — the path is `<W>/build` or `<W>/build-*` at depth 1, `<W>`
#      is a directory `git worktree list` reports for THIS repository,
#      `<W>/.git` exists, the path is a real directory rather than a symlink,
#      and git's own ignore rules report the directory as ignored. That last
#      check is the per-item evidence that the content is regenerable: a name
#      convention is not proof, an ignore rule is.
#   2. HISTORY — the exact worktree HEAD is a strict ancestor of the current
#      default branch. A deleted remote branch is not completion evidence:
#      unique commits must never lose their only warm build by inference.
#   3. MERGE PROOF — this exact head landed, proven EITHER by the local
#      continuity registry (branch + HEAD recorded `merged` with the merged PR
#      as provenance, which also covers squash merges) OR by git directly, via
#      strict ancestry of the freshly fetched default tip. The registry alone
#      used to be mandatory. That made a missing or stale bookkeeping row veto
#      an ancestry git could prove on demand, and absence of a record is not
#      evidence of non-merge — it is evidence that nobody wrote one down.
#   3b. QUIESCENT — no uncommitted tracked work in the worktree. An edit does
#      not move HEAD, so the merge proof above cannot see one.
#   4. IDLE — nothing under the build directory modified in the last
#      PULP_WORKTREE_BUILD_IDLE_HOURS hours (default 2).
#   5. QUIET — the shared build-directory exclusion lock is held by this
#      reaper, and no other live process names, holds open, or has its cwd in
#      the worktree.
#
# Each condition is individually imperfect; requiring all five is what makes the
# combination safe. It is conservative in one direction only: a directory that
# cannot be proven finished is kept.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/scripts/clean_worktree_builds.sh                 # dry-run: list + total reclaimable
#   tools/scripts/clean_worktree_builds.sh --yes           # delete
#   tools/scripts/clean_worktree_builds.sh --verbose       # also explain every skip
#   PULP_WORKTREE_BUILD_IDLE_HOURS=24 …                    # widen the idle window
#   PULP_WORKTREES_ROOT=/path/prefix …                     # only worktrees under this prefix
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — ran (deleted, or listed what it would delete)
#   2 — bad argument or bad configuration
#   3 — could not reach origin, so branch state is unknown; nothing removed
#
# Scheduling this is deliberately NOT part of the script. Whether a machine runs
# a reaper on a timer, and how often, is an operator decision.
